## Search Algorithms 
##### What is a search algorithm?
A search algorithm is a method for finding an item or group of items in a collection of data. The data may be stored in a variety of data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, trees, and graphs. There are different types of search algorithms, but they all have the same goal: to locate the item(s) that match a particular search criteria.

### What is a linear search?
A linear search, also known as a sequential search, is a simple search algorithm that checks each item in a collection of data one by one until it finds the item it is looking for. It starts at the beginning of the data structure and moves sequentially through each item until it reaches the end of the structure or finds the target item.

The linear search algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of items in the collection. This means that as the number of items increases, the time it takes to find the target item also increases linearly.

### What is a binary search?
A binary search is a more efficient search algorithm than a linear search. It is used to search for an item in a sorted collection of data by repeatedly dividing the collection in half until the item is found. The algorithm works by comparing the target item with the middle item in the collection, and if the target item is less than the middle item, it searches in the lower half of the collection, otherwise it searches in the upper half of the collection.

The binary search algorithm has a time complexity of O(log n), which means that it is much faster than a linear search algorithm for large collections of data.

### What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs?
The best search algorithm to use depends on the specific requirements of your application. If you have a small collection of data that is unsorted, a linear search algorithm may be sufficient. However, if you have a large collection of data that is sorted, a binary search algorithm would be more appropriate.

There are other types of search algorithms that may be useful in specific situations, such as hash tables, tree-based searches, and graph-based searches. It is important to choose the appropriate search algorithm based on the size and structure of your data, as well as the performance requirements of your application.
